### **Terminology/Background**
---
**Organ of Corti:** [[Audition/Auditory transduction\|transduction]] occurs inside the organ of corti.
- It sits on the basilar membrane.
- The basilar membrane vibrates in response to sound and supports the organ of Corti.

There are less inner hair cells on top of the **basilar membrane** compared to the outside.
- Around 3500 inner hair cells.
- Around 12000 outer hair cells.

These hair cells are the receptors used for hearing.
- The stereocilia are the ends of the hair cells that *bend* in response to vibrations of the Organ of Corti (as the basilar membrane moves up and down).
	- The tips of brush against the tectorial membrane or the fluid surrounding it.
- The tectorial membrane extends *over* the hair cells.
