### **Terminology/Background**
---
**Dorsal Stream (where pathway):** starts in the *posterior* core and belt and extends to the parietal and prefrontal cortices.
- Responsible for ==locating== sounds.

The other pathway/stream that is closely related to this is the [[Audition/Ventral Stream\|ventral stream]], which is responsible for identifying sounds.

Evidence from neural recordings, brain damage, and brain scanning support these findings.

### **Auditory processing**
#### **Location detection**
---
Tasks that require location detection has been associated with greater activation in dorsal areas.

#### **Evidence from brain damage**
---
Patients with [[Temporal Lobe\|Temporal Lobe]] damage ('what' pathway) has trouble ==*recognizing== sounds*, but can localize. While patients with parietal lobe damage ('where' pathway) can recognize sounds, but is ==very poor with localization==.

These two cases show a double-dissociation of function that proves these two pathways are responsible for these specific functions.

**Key takeaway:**
> Deactivating the posterior auditory cortex ('where' pathway) eliminated the ability to localize sounds (but spared identification).
