### **Terminology/Background**
---
**Auditory transduction:** this process takes place by
- Movement of *inner* hair cells **stereocilia** in one direction which opens up ion channels via tip links.
	- When the tip links are open, they allow potassium ions to rush in.
	- This process releases neurotransmitters.
	- Neurotransmitters bind to the [[Audition/Auditory nerve fiber\|Auditory nerve fiber]], causing it to depolarize.
	- On average, each inner hair cell sends signals to 10 spiral ganglion cells (divergent connection).
- Movement in the other direction closes the channels.
- Outer hair cells **amplifies** this activity.

Transduction of complex tones function similarly â€” the basilar membrane will respond at all the locations that correspond to the frequencies that make up the complex tone.
- There will be a peak for every frequency on the basilar membrane.

The basilar membrane can be described as an acoustic prism/filter.
- There are peaks in the membrane's vibration that correspond to each harmonic in a complex tone.
- Each peak is associated with the frequency of a harmonic.
- Fourier analysis can decompose complex waves into individual components.
	- Similar thing going on here.
