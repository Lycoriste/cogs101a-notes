### **Terminology/Background**
---
**Ear anatomy:** has three sections — the outer, middle, and inner ear.

### **Outer ear structure**
---
- **Pinna**: helps with locating and amplifying sound.
	- Important in [[Audition/Monaural cues\|monaural cues]].
	- [[Audition/Hoffman et al. (1998) Experiment\|Hoffman et al. (1998) Experiment]] shows how altering the shape of the pinna affects locating sound on the elevation plane.
- **Auditory canal** (earhole)
	- Protects the **tympanic membrane/eardrum**.
	- Creates resonance when sound waves reflect off the end of the canal.
	- **Amplifies** frequencies that are common in speech.
		- The _resonant frequency_ is the most reinforced frequency.
- **Tympanic membrane**: ** Responds to pressure waves in the air – basically sound waves caused by vibrations.
	- Vibration of tympanic membrane – sound waves reaching it – will propagate through to the middle ear.
	- This vibration is transmitted to the structures in the middle ear.

### **Middle ear structure**
---
- **The ==ossicles== are the three smallest bones in your body.** There are three kinds of ossicles.
	- Malleus (aka the hammer): receives vibrations from the tympanic membrane and transmits this vibration to the incus.
	- Incus (aka the anvil): receives vibrations from the malleus and transmits it to the stapes.
	- Stapes (the “stirrup”): transmits vibrations to the **oval window**, which sends it to the inner ear.

### **Inner ear structure**
---
- Main structure is the [[Audition/Cochlea\|Cochlea]].
	- It is a snail-shaped structure about 35mm long filled with fluid that receives vibration by the stapes.
	- Sound waves are **transduced** into neural signals within the cochlea.
	- Signals will be transmitted out of the cochlea via the **auditory nerve**.
- The inner ear is mostly filled with cochlear fluid as opposed to air in the outer and middle ear.
