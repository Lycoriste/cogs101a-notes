### Effects of training on tonotopic maps
---
Effects of training/experience-dependent plasticity on [[Audition/Tonotopic Maps\|Tonotopic Maps]] has been investigated through a study using owl monkeys.

These monkeys were trained to discriminate between two frequencies near 2500 Hz.

Trained monkeys showed tonotopic maps (in [[Audition/Primary Auditory Cortex\|A1]]) with enlarged areas containing neurons that responded to 2500 Hz compared to untrained monkeys. ==The monkeys were better at the task after training==.
