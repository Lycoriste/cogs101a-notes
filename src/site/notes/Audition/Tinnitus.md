### **Terminology/Background**
---
**Tinnitus:** the perception of a 'ringing' sound in the ears.

**Types of tinnitus:**
1. **Objective tinnitus:** an actual sound is produced in the ears. This may be due to middle ear muscle spasms, spontaneous **==otoacoustic emissions==** (produced by inner ear), or vascular problems.
2. **Subjective tinnitus:** experienced just by the individual, usually in association with another disorder. Most common with noise-induced hearing loss.
	- Associated with both conductive and sensorineural hearing loss.
