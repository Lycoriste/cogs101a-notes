### **Terminology/Background**
---
**Tonotopic Maps:** an organized representation of sound frequencies in the brain, typically found in the [[Audition/Primary Auditory Cortex\|auditory cortex]]. It reflects how different parts of the auditory system respond preferentially to specific sound frequencies, creating a spatial arrangement of tones.

**Location**: can be found in [[Audition/Primary Auditory Cortex\|A1]] (core area).

Neurons that respond ==better to low frequencies are on the left== and those that respond ==best to higher frequencies are on the right==.

Below, single cell recordings in macaque monkeys show tonotopic in [[Audition/Primary Auditory Cortex\|A1]].

### Effects of training on tonotopic maps
---
Effects of training/experience-dependent plasticity on tonotopic maps has been investigated through a study using owl monkeys.

These monkeys were trained to discriminate between two frequencies near 2500 Hz.

Trained monkeys showed tonotopic maps (in [[Audition/Primary Auditory Cortex\|A1]]) with enlarged areas containing neurons that responded to 2500 Hz compared to untrained monkeys. ==The monkeys were better at the task after training==.
