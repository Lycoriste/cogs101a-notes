### **Terminology/Background**
---
**Interaural level difference (ILD):** a [[Audition/Binaural cues\|binaural cue]] that uses the difference in sound pressure level reaching the two ears.
- Reduction in intensity occurs for **high frequency sounds** for the far ear (pointed away from the sound source).
	- The head casts an **acoustic shadow** â€” blocking out/reflecting and absorbing some of the high-frequency pressure wave.
- This effect doesn't occur for low frequency sounds. Work best above 800Hz.

It is largest at locations farther to the side.
