### **Terminology/Background**
---
**Phase locking:** 
- Nerve fibers fire in bursts.
- Bursts happen at or near the peak of the traveling wave.
- This makes them "locked in phase" with the wave.
- A single neuron must rest after firing/refractory period. 
- This establishes a **limit** for its individual signaling capacity.

Across fibers â€”
- Groups of fibers may fire at different peaks.
- Many spiral ganglion fibers can synapse on the same inner hair cell.
- Neurons do not need to activate at each peak. Different cells can respond to different peaks.
	- Combining the activity of these neurons can recreate a frequency beyond the response capacity of a neuron.
- This could provide information about the spacing of the missing fundamental and other harmonics.
