### **Terminology/Background**
---
**Bone-anchored hearing implant:** helps overcome damage to the middle and outer ear (**[[Audition/Hearing Loss\|conductive hearing loss]]**). The inner hair cells must be intact.

A titanium implant is placed in the bone behind the ear. A removable sound processor is attached to the titanium implant.

Sound signals/vibrations are sent to the cochlea via ==bone conduction==.
