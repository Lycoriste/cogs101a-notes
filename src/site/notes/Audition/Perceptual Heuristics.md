Auditory grouping principles/heuristics help us organize elements of the [[Audition/Auditory Scene\|Auditory Scene]].

For ==**simultaneous** grouping== (separating sources):
1. **Location:** a single sound source tends to be at one location and to move continuously (similar to ==common fate from Gestalt principles==).
2. **Onset synchrony:** sounds that start together, belong together. Sounds that start at different times are likely to be from different sources.
3. **Timbre and pitch:** sounds with the same pitch or timbre are grouped together with the same distinct source (similar to ==similarity from Gestalt principles).
	- E.g. flute trills belong to flutes, while trumpet blares belong to trumpets, etc.
4. **Harmonicity:** when we hear a harmonic series (*fundamental and harmonics*), we infer that it comes from a single source.

For ==**sequential** grouping== (keeping together):
1. **Similarity of pitch:** consecutive sounds of similar pitch are associated with a single source and grouped together.
2. **Proximity in time:** sounds that occur in rapid succession usually come from the same source (similar to ==proximity from Gestalt principles==).
3. **Auditory continuity:** sounds that stay constant or change smoothly are usually from the same source.
	- [[Audition/Richard Warren et al. (1972) Auditory Continuity\|Richard Warren et al. (1972) Auditory Continuity]]
4. **Effect of experience:** we can use top-down knowledge to form expectations about what we are hearing. In the case of music, we use **melody schemas** to identify tunes or songs (similar to ==familiarity from Gestalt principles==).

These groupings allow us to perform ==**auditory stream segregation**== based on attributions of different pitch and timing to multiple sources.
