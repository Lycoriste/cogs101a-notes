### **Terminology/Background**
---
**Auditory scene:** the array of all sound sources (and their qualities) in the environment.
**Auditory Space:** the area surrounding an observer which includes sound signals and locations.
- Researchers study how sounds are [[Audition/Auditory Localization\|localized]].

### **Auditory Scene Analysis**
---
The way sound sources in the [[Audition/Auditory Scene\|auditory scene]] are ==separated== into individual perceptions. This does not happen at the cochlea since simultaneous sounds are together in the pattern of vibrations on the basilar membrane.

In auditory analysis, we are faced with two different situations:
1. **Simultaneous grouping:** when multiple sounds are simultaneously active, how do we separate sources?
	- How is the singer separated from the guitar?
2. **Sequential grouping:** as sounds follow each other in time, how do we perceive them as staying together?
	- How does the melody produced by the keyboard stay grouped together?

We can understand this through ==**[[Audition/Perceptual Heuristics\|perceptual heuristics]]**==.
