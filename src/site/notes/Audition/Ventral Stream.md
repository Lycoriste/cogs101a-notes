### **Terminology/Background**
---
**Ventral Stream (what/how pathway):** starts in the *anterior* portion of the core and belt and extends to the prefrontal cortex.
- Responsible for ==identifying== sounds.

The other pathway/stream that is closely related to this is the [[Audition/Dorsal Stream\|dorsal stream]], which is responsible for locating sounds.

Evidence from neural recordings, brain damage, and brain scanning support these findings.

### **Auditory processing**
#### **Pitch recognition**
---
Tasks that require pitch recognition has been associated with higher activation in the ventral regions.

#### **Evidence from brain damage**
---
Patients with [[Temporal Lobe\|Temporal Lobe]] damage ('what' pathway) has trouble ==*recognizing== sounds*, but can localize. While patients with parietal lobe damage ('where' pathway) can recognize sounds, but is ==very poor with localization==.

These two cases show a double-dissociation of function that proves these two pathways are responsible for these specific functions.

**Key takeaway:**
> Temporarily deactivating the anterior auditory area ('what' pathway) impaired a catâ€™s ability to distinguish tone patterns (but spared localization).
