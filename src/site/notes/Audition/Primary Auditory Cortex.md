### **Terminology/Background**
---
**Primary Auditory Cortex:** the first cortical region to receive auditory information in the [[Temporal Lobe\|Temporal Lobe]].

It is believed to have a broadly **tonotopic** organization, matching the structure established in the cochlea. There are thought to be multiple [[Audition/Tonotopic Maps\|tonotopic maps]] in the auditory cortex.

- In A1, different patches of cortex respond to different characteristic frequencies (CF).
- There is a **tonotopic** response to pure tones and natural sounds.

Natural sounds includes but not limited toâ€¦
- Speech
- Laughter
- Animal sounds
- Musical instruments
- Tools

The auditory cortex appears to be ==hierarchically organized==.
- Neural signals travel through the core (including A1), then belt, followed by the parabelt area.
- Simple sounds (pure tones) cause tonotopic activation in the core area.
- ==**Belt** (A2) and **parabelt** (A3)== areas are preferentially activated in response to more complex stimuli (tones, voices) made up of many frequencies.

Mostly activated by ==pure high/low tones played individually==.
