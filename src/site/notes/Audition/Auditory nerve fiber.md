### **Terminology/Background**
---
**Auditory nerve fiber:** these signal frequency.

There are two ways for them to signal frequencies:
1. Which/where nerve fibers are responding
	- Specific groups of hair cells on basilar membrane activate a specific set of nerve fibers.
	- **Place theory**.
2. How/when fibers are firing
	- Rate or pattern of firing of nerve impulses.
	- **Temporal coding**.

**Place coding** gives some information for (almost) the entire frequency range of hearing.
- This excludes very low frequencies.

**Temporal coding** with phase locking seems effective up to 4-5kHz.

Both codes generally work for frequencies below 4-5kHz, though **temporal coding** is probably the most important mechanism for pitch perception.

Human hearing seems to be poor at detecting melodies using frequencies above 5000Hz.

The auditory nerve fibers synapse in a series of subcortical structures â€”
1. Cochlear nucleus
2. [[Audition/Superior olivary nucleus\|Superior olivary nucleus]] (in the brain stem).
	- Binaural information is first mixed here.
3. Inferior colliculus (in the midbrain).
4. Medial geniculate nucleus (MGN) in the [[Thalamus\|thalamus]].
5. Auditory receiving area ([[Audition/Primary Auditory Cortex\|A1]] in the [[Temporal Lobe\|Temporal Lobe]]).
