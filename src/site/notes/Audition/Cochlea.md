### **Terminology/Background**
---
**Cochlea:** located in the inner ear.

It is a snail-shaped structure about 35mm long filled with fluid that receives vibration by the stapes.
	- Sound waves are **transduced** into neural signals within the cochlea.
	- Signals will be transmitted out of the cochlea via the **auditory nerve**.

### **Structural organization**
---
- It is a hard, boney structure.
- Divided into the scala vestibuli (above with the oval window) and scala tympani (below with the round window) by the **cochlear partition**.
	- Scala vestibuli up; scala tympani down.
- Cochlear partition extends from the base (the stapes side) to the apex (top end).
- The **[[Audition/Organ of Corti\|Organ of Corti]]** is contained within the cochlear partition (in the scala media â€” between vestibuli and tympani).
