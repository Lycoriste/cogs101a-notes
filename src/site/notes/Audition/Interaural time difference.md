### **Terminology/Background**
---
**Interaural time difference (ITD):** difference between the times at which sounds reach the two ears.
- When the distance to each ear is the same, there are no differences in time.
- When the source is to the side of the observer, the times will differ.
- This cue is better for *low frequency* tones (<800Hz).
	- May use temporal coding (phase locking) in the cochlea.
- This is considered the **dominant** [[Audition/Binaural cues\|binaural cue]] for hearing because most environment sounds have low-frequency components.
