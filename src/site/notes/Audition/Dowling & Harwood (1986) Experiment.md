### **Terminology/Background**
---
**Dowling & Harwood (1986) Experiment:** 
- A melody ("Three Blind Mice") is played with notes alternating between octaves.
- Listeners find it difficult to identify the song.
- But after they hear the normal melody, they can then 'hear'/recognize it in the modified version using **melody schema**.
- Usage of **top-down knowledge** can guide perception.

This experiment demonstrates the [[Audition/Perceptual Heuristics\|effect of experience]].
