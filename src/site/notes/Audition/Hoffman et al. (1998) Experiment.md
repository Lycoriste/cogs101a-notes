### **Terminology/Background**
---
**Hoffman et al. (1998) Experiment:** a psychophysics experiment investigating [[Audition/Auditory Localization\|spectral cues]].
1. Listeners’ accuracy was measured while locating sounds differing in elevation.  
2. They were then fitted with an ear mold that changed the shape of their pinna.  
3. If the shape of the pinna is ==important for elevation judgments==, subjects ==***should*** show a large decrease in performance==.

**Results:**
1. Right after the molds were inserted, performance was poor for elevation but was unaffected for azimuth. 
2. After 19 days, performance for elevation was ==close to original performance==.  
3. Once the molds were removed, performance remained high. 
4. One suggestion is that there might be two different sets of neurons—one for each set of *spectral cues* (new and old).
