### **Terminology/Background**
---
The study presented complex harmonic tones with the same *fundamental frequency* (182 Hz) to marmoset monkeys in order to observe activity of cells that located just outside of [[Audition/Primary Auditory Cortex\|A1]].

Single-cell recordings were done outside of the [[Audition/Primary Auditory Cortex\|A1]] area and six different sounds were played.

The recording of a single cell just outside of the [[Audition/Primary Auditory Cortex\|A1]] found that it responded to **complex tones** with the same fundamental frequency. Such cells were called **[[Audition/Pitch Neuron\|pitch neurons]]**.

- Demonstrated hierarchical organization in the auditory cortex.
- Links perception to physical quality of sound.
