### **Terminology/Background**
---
This study used fMRI to ==measure responses to complex tones perceived as pitch== (110Hz) and frequency-matched noise.
- The noise stimulus contained all the frequencies, but ==wasn't *perceived==* as having a specific pitch.
- Areas in *anterior auditory cortex* were more responsive to pitch.
