### **Terminology/Background**
---
**Binaural cues:** these are location cues for [[Audition/Auditory Localization\|Auditory Localization]] based on the comparison of the signals received by the left and right ears.

There are two types of binaural cues â€”
1. [[Audition/Interaural time difference\|Interaural time difference]] (ITD)
2. [[Audition/Interaural level difference\|Interaural level difference]] (ILD)

ITD and ILD provide useful cues for judging locations along most of the azimuth plane (position from left to right).

However, they are not effective from detecting differences in elevation.
- Consider points A and B with A being on top and B bottom.
	- The level and time differences of signals reaching each ear is zero.
- There is a similar ambiguity at points C and D, with C on the left and D on the right.
- These points are said to lie on a **cone of confusion**.
- Multiple/infinite cones of confusion are possible.

This suggests that an additional cue is necessary for reliable **elevation** judgment.
