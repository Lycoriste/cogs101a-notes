### **Terminology/Background**
---
**Place theory:** this is a theory that explains how [[Audition/Auditory nerve fiber\|Auditory nerve fiber]] signals frequency.
- Frequency of a sound is indicated by the location/place (of hair cells) along the [[Audition/Cochlea\|Cochlea]] that has the **highest firing rate**.
- Georg Von Bekesy (who proposed this theory) determined this in two ways —
	- Direct observation of the vibrational properties of the basilar membrane in cadavers.
	- Building a model of the [[Audition/Cochlea\|Cochlea]] using the physical properties of the basilar membrane,

**The physical properties of the basilar membrane**
- Base of the membrane (next to the stapes) is
	- 3 to 4 times narrower than it is at the apex.
	- 100 times stiffer than at the apex.
- Both the model and direct observation showed that the vibrating motion of the membrane is a **traveling wave**.

Envelope of the traveling wave…
- Most of the basilar membrane vibrates in response to a traveling wave, but the displacement is largest in one place.
- The envelope shows the entire displacement caused by a traveling wave and its peak (maximum).
- Hair cells at this maximum point are stimulated the strongest — leading to the nerve fibers firing the most at this location.
- The position of the peak is a function of frequency.

Envelopes at different frequencies show different maximum vibration points. This indicates the place where most hair cell activity is predicted.
- **Low** frequencies activated toward the apex, while high frequencies activate hair cells near the base.

Evidence from electrode recordings
- Electrodes were placed outside the cochlea of a guinea pig while different pure frequency tones were presented.
- Cochlea shows an orderly map of frequencies along its length.
	- Apex responds best to low frequencies.
	- Base responds best to high frequencies.
- This is called a **tonotopic map**.

Physiological support for the theory — neural frequency tuning curves
- Pure tones are used to determine the threshold for specific frequencies measured at single neurons.
- Recorded action potentials from one auditory nerve fiber along the cochlea and play tones at different frequencies.
- Plotting thresholds for frequencies results in tuning curves.
- Frequency to which the neuron is most sensitive (lowest threshold) is the **characteristic frequency**.

Psychophysical support — auditory masking experiment
- Thresholds for a number of frequencies are determined.
- Then, an intense masking frequency is presented at the same time that the thresholds for the original frequencies are re-determined.
- The **masking effect** (raised threshold) is seen at the masking tone's frequency and spreads to higher frequencies more than lower ones.
- The masking effect matches the predicted envelope created by traveling waves. Higher frequencies should be affected.

The original place theory model proposed by Bekesy predicted less basilar membrane movement (less sensitivity) to different frequencies.
- Bekesy used basilar membranes isolated from the cadavers and his results showed no difference in response for close frequencies that people can distinguish.
- Newer research with *live* membranes shows that the entire **outer hair cells** respond to sound by slight tilting and a change in length.
	- For this reason, the outer hair cells are called the **cochlear amplifier**.

By selectively destroying outer hair cells (via **chemical ablation**), we can see a decrease in the firing rate of inner hair cell at its **characteristic frequency**.

How is amplitude/sound intensity encoded?
- We perceive a sound's intensity as its *loudness*.
- Intense vibrations cause greater movement of the basilar membrane.
- The cochlear amplifier acts to sharpen vibrational energy at a specific location on the basilar membrane, activating inner hair cells at a characteristic frequency.
- If you increase the intensity of the signal, that inner hair cell becomes more active.
- Additionally, neighboring hair cells also respond more to the sound as intensity increases.

There are certain problems with place theory —
1. We can perceive a pitch even when the associated frequency (and vibration on the basilar membrane) are **absent**.
	- This causes what we know as the effect of the missing fundamental.
2. Place information is poor at encoding very low frequencies (< 50 Hz).
	- Basilar membrane doesn't move distinctly at the apex.
3. We can perceive pitch in a very noisy stimuli, where place information is ambiguous.
	- This **amplitude-modulated noise**, where the primary change in intensity, results in the perception of a pitch.
