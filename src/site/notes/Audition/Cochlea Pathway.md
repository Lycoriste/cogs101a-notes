### **Terminology/Background**
---
Auditory nerve fibers synapse in a series of subcortical structures:
1. Cochlear nucleus.
2. Superior olivary nucleus (in the brain stem); *binaural* information first mixed here.
3. Inferior colliculus (in the midbrain).
4. Medial geniculate nucleus (MGN, in the thalamus).
5. Auditory receiving area ([[Audition/Primary Auditory Cortex\|A1]] in the temporal lobe).
