### **Terminology/Background**
---
**Hearing Aids:** the most common kind of device that aids auditory perception. This device amplifies sound signals to overcome [[Audition/Hearing Loss\|sensorineural hearing loss]].

Requires a functional middle ear and (some) intact inner hair cells.

Can be customized for specific profiles of hearing loss (e.g. specific frequencies.)

May reduce **[[Audition/Tinnitus\|tinnitus]]**, but is mainly for the improvement of speech and environment sounds.
