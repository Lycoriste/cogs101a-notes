### **Terminology/Background**
---
**Monaural cues:** an auditory cue that allows for [[Audition/Auditory Localization\|auditory localization]].

The pinna and head affect the intensities of frequencies.

This is the **head-related transfer function (HRTF)** and is unique to each head.
- Measurements have been performed by placing small microphones in ears and comparing the intensities of frequencies with those at the sound source.
	- This is a **spectral cue** since the information for location comes from the spectrum of frequencies.

In short, the shape of our pinna affects how we perceive/receive auditory cues.
