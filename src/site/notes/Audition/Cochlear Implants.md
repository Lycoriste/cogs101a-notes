### **Terminology/Background**
---
**Cochlear Implants:** a device that uses electrodes inserted into the cochlea to electrically stimulate auditory nerve fibers along the basilar membrane's tonotopic map.

The device includes:
1. A microphone
2. Sound processor
3. Transmitter (outside)
4. Receiver (surgically implanted)

Allows users to overcome damage to the hair cells (sensorineural loss) but not damage to the cochlear auditory nerves.

Very effective for speech perception if done early (by 12-18 months).
