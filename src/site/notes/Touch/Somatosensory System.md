### **Terminology/Background**
---
**Three components of the somatosensory system:** 
1. **Proprioception:** the ability to sense the position of the body and limbs.
	- Our static perception of our bodies, caused by feedback from the skin, muscles, and joints.
2. **Kinesthesis:** the ability to sense movement of the body and limbs.
	- Tracks our body as it moves.
	- Information is sent to the spinal cord and brain from **==proprioceptors==**: **Golgi tendon organs** (monitor tension) and **muscle spindles** (monitor stretch and speed).
	- Motor signals return to the muscle to execute both planned and automatic movements.
3. **[[Touch/Cutaneous senses\|Cutaneous senses]]:** perception of touch and pain from stimulation of skin.
