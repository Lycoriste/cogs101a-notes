### **Terminology/Background**
---
**Ian Waterman:** has no sensory input from his **proprioceptors** in his muscles and joints.
- No information from **mechanoreceptors** in his skin that would respond to the physical objects in his environment.
- However, he is still able to feel pain and temperature (single dissociation).

Ian was able to move and walk, while the other gentleman (Charles Freedman) was bound to a wheelchair.

He was able to compensate with the use of **visual information** to update his brain on his body's position.
- This shows the underlying multimodal nature of proprioception (and cutaneous senses).
