### **Terminology/Background**
---
**Gate control model:** a model of pain proposed by Melzack and Wall (1965, 1988). The gate consists of **substantia gelatinosa** cells in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord (SG- and SG+). 

Input into the gate comes from:
- Small diameter (S) fibers - information from nociceptors.
- Large diameter (L) fibers - information from tactile stimuli (mechanoreceptors).
- Central control - information from top-down cognitive factors (descending pathway from the cortex).

Gate output is a transmission cell (denoted T-cell) activity. More T-cell activity means more intense pain.
- Pain *decreases* when the gate is closed by stimulation of SG- by central control or L-fibers.
	- ==Inhibitory interneuron== interrupts incoming pain signals.
- Pain *increases* when stimulation of the **S-fibers** activates SG+ to open the gate.
