### **Terminology/Background**
---
**Direct pathway model of pain:** suggests that nociceptors are stimulated by the appropriate stimuli and immediately send signals to the brain.
- Pain is a signal that elicits a withdrawal response.

**Problems with the model:**
- Pain can be affected by a person's mental state.
	- If you are happy, you are more tolerant of pain.
- Pain can occur when there is no stimuli of the skin.
	- **Phantom limbs** cause pain
	- Pain also may be referred to another location (e.g. headaches and heart attacks).
- Pain can be affected by a person's attention.
	- If you are unaware of an injury, you may ignore the pain.
