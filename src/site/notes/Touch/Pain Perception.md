### **Terminology/Background**
---
**Pain Perception:** skin uses pain receptors as a threat detection system. Pain is defined as the ==unpleasant ***sensory*** and ***emotional*** experience associated with actual or potential issue damage, or described in terms of such damage==.

**Pain** is a ==multimodal== phenomenon containing a **sensory** component and an **affective** or cognitive component.
- The threshold for pain detection must be balanced to warn of potential damage, but not respond to normal activity.
- People with **congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP)** do not experience pain and can unintentionally injure themselves while performing everyday activities.
- **Sensory processing disorder (SPD)** can result when an individual is too sensitive to common sensations.

#### **Types of pain:**
---
**Nociceptive pain:** signals impending damage to the skin.
- Specific nociceptors respond to heat, chemicals, severe pressure, and cold.
	- **==Nociceptors==** are a type of free nerve ending/pain receptors that activate in response to the release of histamine, substance p, and prostaglandin from tissue damage.
- These typically trigger a protective withdrawal response.

**Inflammatory pain:** caused by damage or irritation within tissues and joints.
- Additionally, infections and/or injury associated with immune responses make nociceptors *more* responsive (**hyperalgesia**).
- Tumor cells (release toxins in the tissue causing immune responses).

**Neuropathic pain:** caused by the damage to the nervous systems, including...
- Brain damage caused by stroke.
- Repetitive movements which can cause conditions like carpal tunnel syndrome.

**Social pain:** a perceived pain resulting from interactions with other people (or lack thereof).
- Also called psychological or mental pain.
- Typical cases involved depression and social rejection.
- No tissue damage, but a strong ==affective== (aversive) element.
- May be linked to subsequent damage (e.g. self-injury).

#### Top-down central control of pain:
---
**Expectation:**
- Placebos can be effective in reducing pain.
- Nocebos, with a negative expectation, can increased experienced pain.

**Shifting attention:** virtual reality technology has been used to keep patients' attention on other stimuli rather than the pain-inducing stimulation.

**Content of emotional distraction:** participants can tolerate more pain (e.g. keep their hands in water longer) when pictures they were shown are positive.

#### **Models of pain:**
---
- [[Touch/Direct pathway model of pain\|Direct pathway model of pain]]
- [[Touch/Gate control model\|Gate control model]]

#### **Cortical representation of pain:**
---
**Subcortical areas:**
- Hypothalamus
- Amygdala
- Thalamus

**Cortical areas:**
- Somatosensory cortex **S1 and S2**
- Insula
- Anterior cingulate
- Prefrontal cortices

This distributed system combined is referred to as the **pain matrix.**
