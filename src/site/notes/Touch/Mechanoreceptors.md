### **Terminology/Background**
---
**Mechanoreceptors:** a set of receptors in the skin that provide details about items that we touch and hold.

The receptors that establish our *cutaneous receptive fields* include
- [[Touch/Merkel receptors\|Merkel receptors]] — fine details
- [[Touch/Meissner corpuscles\|Meissner corpuscles]] — handgrip
- [[Touch/Ruffini cylinders\|Ruffini cylinders]] — stretching
- [[Touch/Pacinian corpuscles\|Pacinian corpuscles]] — rapid vibration and fine texture

Merkel receptors and Meissner corpuscles have 
- small cutaneous receptive fields
- high acuity.
- located closer to the surface of the skin.
