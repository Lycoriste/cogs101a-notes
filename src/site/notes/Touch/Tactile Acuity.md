### **Terminology/Background**
---
**Tactile Acuity:** sensitivity to details on the skin.

**Methods to measure:**
1. **[[Touch/Two-point threshold\|Two-point threshold]]:** minimum separation needed between two points to perceive them as two points.
2. **Grating acuity:** place a grooved stimulus on the skin and ask the participant to indicate the orientation of the grating.
3. **Raised pattern identification:** using letters or simple shapes to determine the smallest size that can be identified.
