### **Terminology/Background**
---
**Papillae:** surface projections distributed on the tongue.

**Types of papillae:**
- **Filiform:** shaped like cones and located over entire surface.
- **Fungiform:** shaped like mushrooms and found on sides and tips.
- **Foliate:** series on back and sides.
- **Circumvallate:** shaped like flat mound trenches in the back.

The human tongue contains around 10,000 taste buds, and there are taste buds located in *all* papillae **EXCEPT** filiform.
- Only filiform papillae are located in the center and we don't have direct taste sensation there.
- Fungiform has 3-5 taste buds each.
- Circumvallate and foliate have more than 100 each.
