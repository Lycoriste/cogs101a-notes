### **Terminology/Background**
---
**Taste (gustation):** provides protective functions by avoiding harmful substances; also provides *pleasure*. It is the detection of molecules in liquid or solid form.
- Consuming to **maintain homeostasis** is a necessary biological function.
- Eating driven by **palatability** (i.e. hedonic value), is driven by learning and reinforcement.

#### **Basic tastes**
---
- **Sweetness:** usually associated with substances that have nutritive and caloric value.
- **Salty:** taste indicates the presence of sodium.
- **Bitter:** usually associated with substances that are potentially harmful (typically in plants).
- **Sour:** indicates high acidity.
- **Umami:** indicates high levels of protein.

There is no perfect connection between tastes and function of substances.

Fat is not recognized as a basic taste, but it may have its own receptors for it.
