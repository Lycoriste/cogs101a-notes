### **Terminology/Background**
---
**Taste bud:** composed of 50-100 taste cells with tips that extend into the taste pore.
- Transduction occurs when chemicals come into contact with receptor sites on the tips (**gustatory hairs**).
- Process not fully understood, but there are numerous receptor types for different tastes (e.g. more than 20 bitter receptor types).
