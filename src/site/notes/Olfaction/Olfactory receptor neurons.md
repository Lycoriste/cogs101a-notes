### **Terminology/Background**
---
**Olfactory receptor neurons:** proteins that respond to chemical odorants. Each receptor is sensitive to a narrow range of odorants.

Transduction occurs here. 
- Only one type of receptor is on each ORN.
- Humans have 400 types of olfactory receptors.
- Humans have roughly 10,000 of each type of ORN.

Signals are then carried from the ORN to the [[Olfaction/Glomeruli\|Glomeruli]] in the olfactory bulbs.
- ORNs of a particular type **converge** their signals on to one or two glomeruli.
- Optical imaging has shown that specific areas of glomeruli may respond to particular odorants.
- A map of odorants exists in the olfactory bulbs. This is a **chemotopic map** (odor map/**odotopic map**).
