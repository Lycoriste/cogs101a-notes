Notes for reviewing the finals. If there’s anything important or missing, email me; if there’s anything wrong, email me.
- These are not crazy detailed notes.
	- Taken last quarter when I took the class.
- Not complete.
- I’ll be updating them actively.
	- Do not have the earlier contents because… someone did not take notes for them.
- ==**Most of these are basically repeating slides**==.
	- Though they’re useful to see how things connect.
- Good luck and have fun.

*There are some formatting issues.*
